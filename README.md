# retail-lakehouse
Turn messy nightly CSVs from a retail chain into clean, ready-to-query tables. Bronze holds raw files, Silver cleans and standardizes, Gold delivers business-ready insights. Learn the lakehouse flow and see data transform. 
Every night, a retail chain dumps thousands of lines of CSVs—sales, products, stores—into a digital abyss. Left unchecked, this data is messy, incomplete, and slow to query. That’s money left on the table.

This Lakehouse project walks you through transforming that raw chaos into a structured, analytics-ready goldmine. Bronze captures the raw data as-is. Silver cleans, validates, and standardizes it. Gold delivers ready-to-use business tables that could power KPIs, dashboards, and strategic decisions.

Think of it as turning data into actionable intelligence, without the fluff. Analysts get reliable numbers, managers get clarity, and engineers build pipelines that scale efficiently. The project demonstrates the full Medallion Architecture with Delta Lake and Spark, giving you hands-on experience.

If you want to understand how modern companies turn data into dollars this repo shows the process end-to-end.
